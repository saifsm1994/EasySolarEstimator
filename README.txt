What is EasySolarEstimator

I found that as someone who knew nothing about solar power most solar power guides and calculators were not helpful, easy, or understandable.

For my graduation project I decided to build a tool which was all of these things.

Towards this goal I had to sacrifice some deal of accuracy as I made the tool automatic which meant no user input.

I have judged this to be an acceptible loss given more accurate tools do exist for more advanced users.


Who is EasySolarEstimator for?

EasySolarEstimator is designed for:

Complete novices who want to know whether solar power would even be viable in their region

Prospective customers who want a ballpark quote from someone who isn't trying to sell them something (albiet a very large ballpark)

People learning about solar power who want to try and understand the differences in levels of solar power around the world
