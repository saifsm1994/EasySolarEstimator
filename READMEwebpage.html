<h2>What is EasySolarEstimator?</h2>
<h4>I found that as someone who knew nothing about solar power most solar power guides
and calculators were not helpful, easy, or understandable.</h4>
<h4>For my graduation project I decided to build a tool which was all of these things.</h4>
<h4>Towards this goal I had to sacrifice some deal of accuracy as I made the tool automatic 
which meant no user input.</h4>
<h4>I have judged this to be an acceptible loss given more accurate tools do exist for more advanced users.</h4>

<h2>Who is EasySolarEstimator for?</h2>

    <h5>Prospective customers who want a ballpark quote from someone who isn't trying to sell them something (albiet a very large ballpark)</h5>
    <h5>People learning about solar power who want to try and understand the differences in levels of solar power around the world</h5>
